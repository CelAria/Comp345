    /*Provide a group of C++ classes that implement a user interaction mechanism to start the game by allowing the
     player to 1) select a map from a list of map files as stored in a directory 2) select the number of players in the
     game (2-6 players). The code should then use the map loader to load the selected map, create all the players,
     assign dice rolling facilities to the players, create a deck of cards, and assign an empty hand of cards to each
     player. You must deliver a driver that demonstrates that 1) different valid maps can be loaded and their validity is
     verified (i.e. it is a connected graph, etc), and invalid maps are gracefully rejected; 2) the right number of players
     is created, a deck with the right number of cards is created. */
