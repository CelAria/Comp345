/*
A tournament starts with the user choosing M = 1 to 5 different maps, P = 2 to 4 different computer players
strategies, G = 1 to 5 games to be played on each map, D = 10 to 50 maximum number of turns for each game. A
tournament is then automatically played by playing G games on each of the M different maps between the chosen
computer player strategies. In order to minimize run completion time, each game should be declared a draw after
D turns. Once started, the tournament plays all the games automatically without user interaction. At the end of the
tournament, a report of the results should be displayed, e.g.

 You must deliver a driver that demonstrates that (1) when the game starts, the user is given the choice between
 single game mode and tournament mode; (2) when the tournament mode is chosen, the user is asked to select
 (2a) from 1 to 5 maps; (2b) from 2 to 4 players which can be any of the computer player strategies (no human
 computer should be allowed in tournament mode); (2c) the number of games (from 1 to 5) to be played on each
 map; (2d) the number of turns after which each game is to be considered a draw (3 to 50 turns); (3) after being
 started, the tournament runs without any user interaction; (4) upon completion, the results of the tournament are
 displayed as depicted above. */
